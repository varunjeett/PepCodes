C++
Priority queue (default is MAX HEAP) :
1.header file of pq is <queue>.
2.we can use array/vector to intiliaze like :
        vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3};
        priority_queue<int> pq(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        or

        int arr2[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 10000};
        priority_queue<int> pq(arr2, arr2 + 4); //(start address , end address +1)

3.
// priority_queue<int, vector<int>> pq;  //by default max
// priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;  //min pq by using greater

IMPORTANT 
The priority queue datatype is built on top of a container class, which is the structure actually used to maintain the values in the collection.
There are two containers in the Standard C++ Library that can be used to construct priority queues: vectors or deques. 
By default, a priority_queue will use vector.
