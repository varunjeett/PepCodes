//IMPORTANT :======================
1.All DS in the collections framework of java can store only objects(wrapper class or custom class objects), not primitive types.
Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque)
and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

2.
Using Comparable Interface
A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object. The class itself must implements the java.lang.Comparable interface to compare its instances.
Consider a Movie class that has members like, rating, name, year. Suppose we wish to sort a list of Movies based on year of release. We can implement the Comparable interface with the Movie class, and we override the method compareTo() of Comparable interface.
--------------------comparable can also be used for sort=-----------------------.
